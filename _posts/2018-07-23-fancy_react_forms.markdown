## My React with Redux Final project

For my final project, I decided to try to recreate some of the look of Typeform's interface and unique data collection UI. I have used Typeform extensively at my current job over the last four years and I've always been impressed about how the simple user interface allows for data collection from even some less tech-savvy users. 

## Setting up the API

## Early UI Mockups

## Redux State Obsticles

## Semantic UI

## React Intersection Observer

## The Final Product
