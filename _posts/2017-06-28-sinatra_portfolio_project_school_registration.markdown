Since I work at a training institute, the instructor, course, and student models are famliar to me. I decided to create a school registration app with user logins for the students. 
Students can sign up, register for classes, view which instructor it teaching which class, view class details and edit their profile. 
The admin user can create, edit, and delete any student's registration or student, any instructor's assigned courses or instructor, and any course info or courses. 

I used the [Pure CSS](https://purecss.io) framework so that I could use their basic styling without having to do everything from scratch while still having a very small external CSS file. I also added my own styling via the /public directory in the Sinatra project. I also added a favicon to the /public directory so that I would top seeing constant 404 errors when I ran rackup. 

I added a small bit of Javascript to the flash messages so that the user can dismiss them. 

I ran into small problems doing this project, but I knew how to debug everything I came up against and never really felt stuck. The preceeding Sinatra labs had similar routes and challenges, so while this was an extension of those lessons, it wasn't onerous.
